				<p>Patrick has dedicated his career to design in media: first designing for the Army Public Affairs site Army.mil and its custom content management system. After working his way up to the role of creative director he took on a new challenge at U.S. News & World Report, designing interface elements and ranking lists while refining his front-end&nbsp;development&nbsp;skills.</p>
				<p>Currently Patrick leads design for Gannett's custom content management system. For the past four years Patrick has worked with product managers, developers, editorial staff, and fellow designers on a complete replacement and update of Gannettâ€™s CMS. He's performed user research, developed a style guide, built prototypes, and designed flows, interfaces, and UI patterns for a suite of tools used daily by hundreds of journalists across the USA&nbsp;TODAY&nbsp;Network. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-slawinski/">Find Patrick on LinkedIn.</a></p>

			<h2>Presto <span class="date">2014 - Present</span></h2>
			<h3>The Project</h3>
			<p>I worked for around two years at U.S. News &amp; World Report as the Senior User Experience Designer. I worked with designers, analysts, editorial staff, and the technical team to help keep the success of U.S. News growing.<p>
			<h3>What I Did</h3>
			<p>My work with U.S. News involved every part of the site. I prototyped the updated header, footer, and site navigation structure, created infographics, designed rankings pages, prototyped article templates, created HTML/CSS buttons, visually unified the U.S. News social media presence, designed advertising campaigns, and more.</p>
			<h3>What I Learned</h3>
			<p>I learned first-hand the realities of the press's survival in the online space. Coordinating design with a team to push U.S. News forward while maintaining a consistent look gave me practical experience working within an established brand. Infographics honed my technical and storytelling chops while the prototypes I built developed my front-end skills.</p>
