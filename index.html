							<p>Patrick has dedicated his career to design in media: first designing for the Army Public Affairs site Army.mil and its custom content management system. After working his way up to the role of creative director he took
								on a new challenge at U.S. News & World Report, designing interface elements and ranking lists while refining his front-end&nbsp;development&nbsp;skills.</p>
							<p>Now Patrick leads design for Gannett's custom content management system, which is used daily by hundreds of journalists across the USA TODAY Network. For the past four years Patrick has worked with product managers,
								developers, editorial staff, and fellow designers on a complete replacement and update of Gannettâ€™s CMS. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-slawinski/">Find Patrick on LinkedIn.</a></p>

			<h2>Gannett CMS <span class="date">2014 - Present</span></h2>
			<h3>Project</h3>
			<p>Gannett's custom CMS powers over 100 news sites visited by more than 100 million readers per month. Sites range in size from small local operations to the large national footprint of USA TODAY. The CMS enables cooperation and
				coordination across the network as editorial resources are shared across the country and content is seamlessly adapted across sites.<p>
					<h3>Work</h3>
					<p>Patrick is the lead designer for Gannett's CMS, shepherding the tool's user interface through a long transition from legacy technology platforms and front-end frameworks to the fully updated position it's in today. Work has
						included user interviews and surveys, persona creation, style guide development, prototype building, SASS stylesheet implementation, rebranding, and iterative modular UI design throughout.</p>
					<h3>Experience Gained</h3>
					<p>Before this Patrick had never been able to work on one single product for such a long period of time and pursued progress and iteration from end to end and from year to year while maintaining a cohesive UI. He gained experience
						with agile design and development processes and became fully integrated within a full stack product team.</p>

			<h3>Project</h3>
			<p>The virtual reality component of the <a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/staffs-arizona-republic-and-usa-today-network">2018 Pulitzer Prize winning</a> USA TODAY Network report <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/border-wall/">The
					Wall</a>. This story brought together reporters, editors, photojournalists, designers, and developers from across the across the country to tell the story of life on the border between the United States and Mexico.<p>
					<h3>Work</h3>
					<p>This project involved a lot of sketching and concepting to figure out how best we could tell a story given the expected content and technological capabilities. The team executed a successful experience following some needed
						pivots as some approaches worked better than others and reporting content came back differently than anticipated. Patrick focused primarily on the user interface but was also deeply involved in the overall presentation of the
						reporting.</p>
					<h3>Experience Gained</h3>
					<p>This was Patrick's first time working on Virtual Reality project as well as his first time designing an interface meant to be viewed in three dimensional space.</p>

			<h3>Project</h3>
			<p>U.S. News &amp; World Report is an internationally known news publisher and producer of ranking lists.<p>
					<h3>Work</h3>
					<p>Patrick spent two years at U.S. News as a Senior User Experience Designer. He collaborated closely with designers, analysts, editorial staff, and the technical team to help keep the success of U.S. News growing. Patrick's work
						with U.S. News involved every part of the site. He prototyped an updated header, footer, and site navigation structure, created infographics, designed rankings pages, prototyped article templates, created HTML/CSS buttons,
						visually unified the U.S. News social media presence, designed advertising campaigns, performed usability tests, and more.</p>
					<h3>Experience Gained</h3>
					<p>Patrick learned first-hand the realities of the press's survival in the online space. He gained practical experience working within an established brand by coordinating design with a team to push U.S. News forward while
						maintaining a consistent look and feel. Infographics honed Patrick's technical and storytelling chops while the prototypes he built developed his front-end skills.</p>

			<h2>Army.mil <span class="date">2006 - 2012</span></h2>

			<h3>Project</h3>
			<p>Army.mil is the news outlet of the United States Army's Office of the Chief of Public affairs. Beyond news, Army.mil regularly features special microsites around events, awards, and anniversaries.<p>
					<h3>Work</h3>
					<p>Patrick worked his way from the bottom to the top of the Army.mil design team. His tenure included designing and building multiple microsites, communicating with clients, creating a shared home for all of these microsites,
						redesigning the home page, mobile article presentation, and search experience, and designing the UI for a custom CMS.</p>
					<h3>Experience Gained</h3>
					<p>This was Patrick's first employment out of college, and working with the Army.mil team was a formative experience. This was also Patrick's job involving the most branding and visual design work. Working as a contractor was a
						valuable experience, especially when it came to working with clients while in a leadership role. The HTML and CSS development experience remains relevant, and the most relevant to Patrick's current work was designing for a
						content management system.</p>
